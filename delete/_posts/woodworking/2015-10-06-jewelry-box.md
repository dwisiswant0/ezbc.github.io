## The Box

A few years ago I built a jewelry box out of Bird's-Eye Maple and cherry as a
gift. The rounded sides and lid frame the hand-carved Celtic knot as the focus
of the box. The design is minimalist, yet elegant. Three compartments await
inside the box, along with a padded tray which rests atop the back compartment.

## Construction

I applied a variety of techniques while constructing this box, much of which I
learned from *Box-making Basics* by David M. Freedman. The box features keyed,
mitered, sides, rabbited slots in order to include supports for the tray, and a
hollowed tray. Below is a short outline of the construction of the box, in
addition to elaboration on some of the more complicated steps.

+ Cut Maple stock for sides and lid. Cut mitered corners on sides.

+ Cut rabbits in back side of box. Glue narrow lips in rabbits to support tray.

+ Cut notch out of top front for lid lip to rest.

+ Cut rabbits for the tray.

+ Cut lid. Cut and sand lid top to a curve. Leave flat square on top.

+ Glue Cherry block onto the flat portion of the lid.

+ Carve the Cherry block on the lid.

+ Route slot for lid lip.

+ Cut lid lip and glue to lid.

+ Drill lid pin-hinge hole in lid and sides.

+ Glue box together.

+ Cut key slots in each side. Glue in Black Walnut keys.

+ Sand sides to curves.

+ Carve tray from Cherry. 

+ Cut and glue in partitions from Black Walnut.

### Key Joints

  I reinforced each mitered side with three Black Walnut keys. I built a
  sliding carriage on the table saw out of 4$\in\times\,$4$\in$ stock. The
  carriage had a right angle slot rotated 45$^\circ$ angle to hold the box
  while sliding over the table saw. <a

  is an example.

### Tray

In order to minimize tangling earrings or rings, I sought to build a tray with
cushioned partitions. I carved the tray by lowering Cherry stock onto straight
plunge router bit on a router table. I installed a jig on all four sides of the
router table to prevent the router from carving through a tray wall. I wrapped
soft foam in black velvet to make three logs, which I glued into the tray.
