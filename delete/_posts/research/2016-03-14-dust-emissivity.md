# Dust Emissivity Background

[Paradis et al.
(2012)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2012A&A...543A.103P/abstract)
explained a possible origin of dark gas through $A_V$ observations is formation
of dust aggregates, inducing a higher dust emissivity. This can be tested using
extinction data, since dust aggregates are expected to have a higher FIR
emissivity than isolated grains, but mostly unaffected optical properties in the
visible and ultra-violet. Therefore, no substantial $A_V$ excess relative to the
gas column density should be observed in that case. The dust emissivity should
therefore increase with $A_V$ if dust is aggregating in dense regions.

# Results

Figures 1 and 2 show the dust emissivity and dust temperature maps from Planck
of the Taurus-California-Perseus (TCP) region. 

The average $\beta$ for diffuse lines of sight in the entire sky is $1.55$
([Planck et al.  2014](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...571A..11P)).
The median values of $\beta$ for the three clouds are all $1.7$. This is
consistent with dust aggregating in these clouds.

Figure 3 shows the 2MASS-derived $A_V$ and $\beta$ relationship.  Taurus and
California show increasing $\beta$ in increasingly dense regions, consistent
with dust aggregation. We can see that $\beta$ is negatively proportional to
$A_V$ for Perseus however. This means that for denser regions, the emissivity
index decreases.

##### Figure 3

$\beta$ vs. 2MASS-derived $A_V$. The increasing $\beta$ with $A_V$ in Taurus
and California is consistent with dust aggregation in dense regions.
