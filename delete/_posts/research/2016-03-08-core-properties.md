# Core Properties

In Table 1 (Table 3 in the paper) we see that the  two models are able to
predict similar HI-to-H2 transition profiles with different assumptions, the
main differences being the presence of FUV-shielding dust associated with H2,
and the phase of the HI associated with dust.

##### Table 1

Core properties. The transition HI surface densities for each model
$\Sigma_{HI}$ K+09, and $\Sigma_{HI}$ S+14 agree with each other very well.
