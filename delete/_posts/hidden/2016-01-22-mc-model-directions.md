# Stellar Streams

# Origin of Horizontal Branch Stars

Belokurov+15 found stellar streams outlined in the
[post](/hidden/2016/01/21/lmc-stellar-streams/) consisting of blue horizontal
branch stars extending nearly 50 kpc away from the LMC. A couple origins of
these streams could be

+ tidal dwarfs separate from the MCs

+ stellar streams stripped from the SMC

  + The composition and kinematics of these stars should be compared to those of
    the SMC in order to address if these HB stellar streams are tidal remnants
    of the SMC, or from another origin.

  + Check with Stephen to address whether or not it was possible for the SMC to
    have passed through the location of the stellar stream. Gretina Besla's
    orbits of the SMC should suffice to answer this question.

+ the gaseous stream formed stellar components

  + the locations of the stellar streams may be associated with the gas.
      Compare the gas kinematics and locations to the stellar components.

    + Stack HI data spatially and in velocity WRT the stellar stream. See work
        by Nigra et al.
        [(2012)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...760...48N) for
        stacking techniques. Also look at THINGS papers.

    + Smooth GASS HI to resolution of stellar streams to pull out diffuse
        emission.

# Ionized H Gas

Another interesting point is whether or not an ionized gas component coincides
with the stellar component. We should estimate the emission measure from
the BHB stars to see what the ionizing potential would be of surrounding
cold gas.

Brianna Smart may have an idea of whether or not the WHAM observations are
suitably reduced to associate WHAM with these structures.

# Cold HI Gas

How far from the MCs do we expect cold gas to form? We expect there to be at
least some cold gas, because Blaire Savage has found H$_2$ absorption in the MS,
which also means there must be some dust in the stream.  Cold gas may be present
offset from the galaxies from either scenario:

+ A tidal interaction or ram pressure pulls diffuse gas away from
    the clouds, then the diffuse gas cools into cold gas.

+ A tidal interaction or ram pressure directly pulls cold gas from the
    galaxies.

By decomposing the stream we could try to understand how the cold gas is
distributed within the stream.

# Future Direction

Whatever the project direction, the null result must be scientifically
interesting.
