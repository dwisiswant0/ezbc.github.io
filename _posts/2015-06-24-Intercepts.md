I am continuing the [discussion](/2015/05/30/Intercepts/) on using $$A_V$$
intercepts.

Some discussion points from [Lombardi et al.
2015](http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201525650)

+ > As mentioned earlier, unrelated foreground or background
material can contribute to the observed PDF. One way to correct for this is to
look at the lowest extinction value in a large area around the cloud and to
remove this amount from the extinction map (see also Schneider et al. 2015). Of
course, this is a crude approximation since the subtracted column density is
taken to be constant within the field. As a result, we expect “corrected”
column densities to be affected by an additional noise equal to the average
scatter of the superimposed material. This quantity, however, can be estimated
(although approximately) by check- ing the off-field column density scatter and
by applying a set of offsets that spans the same range in extinction.

+ Foreground and background likely dominate the extinction below $$A_k < 0.1$$
  mag, or about $$A_V < 0.9$$ mag. 

+ The PDFs for the clouds in their sample ($$\rho$$ Ophiucus, Perseus, Orion B,
  Orion A, Polaris, Pipe, California and Taurus) show truncation between $$A_k
  \sim 0.07$$ mag to $$0.14$$ mag. These values are similar to those found for
  the $$HI-H_2$$ transition found by theory, $$A_k \sim 0.04$$ to $$0.1$$ mag
