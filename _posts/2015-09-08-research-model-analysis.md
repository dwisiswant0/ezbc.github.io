## ** Previous Modeling **

About 6 months ago I performed steady-state model analysis of the HI to H$_2$
transition for Taurus, California and Perseus. This analysis was for the
[initial](/2015/03/02/Perseus-HI-Threshold/) DGR and N(HI) derivations, where
the HI threshold surface densities were on order of $\Sigma_{\rm HI} \sim 4
M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ for Taurus and $\sim 20 M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ for California.
