Here is the original [all-grain recipe](http://byo.com/hops/item/2349-gose)
which I reformatted into a [Brewtoad
recipe](https://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/german-gose-1). If ever I come across
[this German
Gose](http://www.gayot.com/beer/top10fall-beers/anderson-valley-holy-gose.html)
I will be sure to take notes.
