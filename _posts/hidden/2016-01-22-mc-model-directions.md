# Stellar Streams

# Origin of Horizontal Branch Stars

Belokurov+15 found stellar streams outlined in the
[post](/hidden/2016/01/21/lmc-stellar-streams/) consisting of blue horizontal
branch stars extending nearly 50 kpc away from the LMC. A couple origins of
these streams could be

+ tidal dwarfs separate from the MCs

+ stellar streams stripped from the SMC

  + The composition and kinematics of these stars should be compared to those of
    the SMC in order to address if these HB stellar streams are tidal remnants
    of the SMC, or from another origin.

  + Check with Stephen to address whether or not it was possible for the SMC to
    have passed through the location of the stellar stream. Gretina Besla's
    orbits of the SMC should suffice to answer this question.

+ the gaseous stream formed stellar components

  + the locations of the stellar streams may be associated with the gas.
      Compare the gas kinematics and locations to the stellar components.

    + Stack HI data spatially and in velocity WRT the stellar stream. See work
        by Nigra et al.
        [(2012)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...760...48N) for
        stacking techniques. Also look at THINGS papers.

Another interesting point is whether or not an ionized gas component coincides
with the stellar component. Brianna Smart may have an idea of whether or not
the WHAM observations are suitably reduced to associate WHAM with these
structures.
