Tomorrow I will be brewing a session IPA. See the [Brewtoad
Recipe](https://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/session-ipa-177). It's a simple beer.

We are considering either an [American Wheat](https://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=126) or an [American Ale](https://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=5) Wyeast.
