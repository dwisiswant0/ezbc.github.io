## Omitting Variance Estimation of Binned Images

Instead of recalculating the errors from the binned data as outlined in section
3.2.5 in [the
paper](https://bitbucket.org/ezbc/taurus_paper/raw/66bfa6ded82b8391715f863004f51d20baa102b5/taurus_paper.pdf),
we can try using the initial errors estimating in the binned image. The errors
in each bin were added in quadrature. Below are likelihood spaces from
Perseus in the initial MLE, before using the best-fit model to estimate the
variance of the binned image.

Figure 1. - Perseus likelihoods from Planck data. The likelihood spaces look
quite realistic. The MLE $$HI$$ width = 13 km/s, DGR $$= 0.09 \times 10^{-20}$$
cm$$^2$$ mag, intercept = $$0.2$$ mag. The likelihood spaces do not well
represent the MLE of each parameter because each likelihood space is
marginalized over another parameter.

The variances of the MLE parameters were unphysically tight in earlier
analysis when we were masking at full resolution, and then binning the unmasked
pixels together. Now we are binning all pixels, and then masking. This allows
for much better estimates of the variance of each binned pixel, because there
are more pixels with errors in each bin.


## Evaluating the Fits

We can plot $$A_V$$ vs. $$N(HI)$$ to examine the distribution of points and the
fitted relationship. I have included the MLE fit as well as a polynomial fit to
the data. We can see for cloud the masking process has successfully masked
outliers which do not follow a linear correlation between $$A_V$$ and
$$N(HI)$$. That is, for the masked data, $$A_V$$ is linearly dependent on
$$N(HI)$$. However, the MLE fit is incorrect, it should agree with the
polynomial fit.

Figure 2. - Perseus $$A_V$$ vs. $$N(HI)$$. The top shows the data points which
the MLE of the parameters were fitted to, i.e., the masked data and
corresponding fit. The bottom shows all the data. Each plot shows the model
line determined by the MLE method, as well as a polynomial fit to the data. The
MLE calculation has the parameter resolution to correctly estimate the
intercept, however is incorrect. This is not consistent.

doesn't show.
