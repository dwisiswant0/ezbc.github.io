## Omitting Variance Estimation of Binned Images

Instead of recalculating the errors from the binned data as outlined in section
3.2.5 in [the
paper](https://bitbucket.org/ezbc/taurus_paper/raw/66bfa6ded82b8391715f863004f51d20baa102b5/taurus_paper.pdf),
we can try using the initial errors estimating in the binned image. The errors
in each bin were added in quadrature. Below are likelihood spaces from
Perseus in the initial MLE, before using the best-fit model to estimate the
variance of the binned image.

Figure 1. - Perseus likelihoods from Planck data. The likelihood spaces look
quite realistic. The MLE $$HI$$ width = 13 km/s, DGR $$= 0.09 \times 10^{-20}$$
cm$$^2$$ mag, intercept = $$0.2$$ mag. The likelihood spaces do not well
represent the MLE of each parameter because each likelihood space is
marginalized over another parameter.

***

The variances of the MLE parameters were unphysically tight in earlier
analysis when we were masking at full resolution, and then binning the unmasked
pixels together. Now we are binning all pixels, and then masking. This allows
for much better estimates of the variance of each binned pixel, because there
are more pixels with errors in each bin.
