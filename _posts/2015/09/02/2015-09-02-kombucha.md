## Kombucha Beer

A couple weeks ago I tried brewing a kombucha beer. I fed the scoby 2 Qrts of
the wort from a Session Irish Red Ale, and 1 Qrt of kombucha starter, 4 tea
bags and 1/4 C sugar. This is not worth repeating. The kombucha is vinegary and
flat. Perhaps I let the kombucha ferment for too long, between 1.5 and 2
weeks.  If one were to try this again, I recommend fermenting for a week only.

I might have more success if I used the pre-boiled wort to feed the scoby. The
hops may very well be hostile to the scoby.

## New Batch

Brewing a new batch. A simple one.

### Execution

1. Fermented the scoby on 9/2 with 3.5 Qrts water steeped in 4 bags of
   oolong, 4 bags of English Breakfast and 1 C sugar. 

2. Bottled on 9/9. A little too sweet. Waiting for another three days, so 10
   days total would benefit the drink.

2. Added back to fermenter with scoby on 9/14. It was too sweet.

3. Bottled on 9/18. Perfect amount of sweetness / vinegar. Average temperature
   was around 70 deg F.
