## Lee+12 method of deriving HI width

Lee+12 derived the HI width a priori to deriving the DGR for Perseus. They used
2MASS $$A_V$$ data to correlate with N(HI) derived using different HI widths.
They used a velocity center of 5 km/s, then used velocity integration ranges
for widths around the center increasing from 2 to 80 km/s. Their methods are
[outlined
here](http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/748/2/75/article#apj409875s3-2). An
important step they made was to mask all pixels with signal to noise ratio less
than 5. With an uncertainty of about 0.2 mag in this data, all pixels below
$$A_V$$ = 1.2 mag are masked. See below for the corresponding region in the
2MASS data.

#### Figure 1

Lee+12 2MASS $$A_V$$ data smoothed to 5 arcmin resolution. The contour
represents the SNR = 5 threshold. Only pixels above this threshold are used to
correlate N(HI) with $$A_V$$. The diffuse lines of sight, where we expect
$$A_V$$ to correlate best with HI are excluded from this analysis, instead only
lines of sight which we expect $$H_2$$ to be present are used to calculate the
HI width.

***

We can see that using this threshold means that only the dense lines of sight
were used to calculate the HI width which best correlated N(HI) with $$A_V$$.
This is the opposite of how we have assumed to derive the HI width.

I decided to run this same experiment of calculating the HI width, except by
keeping the diffuse lines of sight and excluding the denser lines of sight.
Below is a comparable figure to [Figure
3](http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/748/2/75/article#apj409875f3) of Lee et
al. (2012). I plotted three different correlations using different $$A_V$$
maps with different masks: 

+ Lee+12 2MASS $$A_V$$ data, masked in the same way as in Lee et al. (2012),
  'Lee+12 Mask'

+ Lee+12 2MASS $$A_V$$ data, all lines-of-sight with $$A_V$$ > 1.2 mag are
  masked, 'Diffuse Mask'. Only diffuse lines-of-sight are used to calculate
  correlation coefficient.

+ Planck $$A_V$$ data, all lines-of-sight with $$A_V$$ > 1.2 mag are masked,
  'Diffuse Mask'. Only diffuse lines-of-sight are used to calculate correlation
  coefficient.

#### Figure 2

Pearson correlation coefficient between  $$A_V$$ and N(HI) data as a function
of HI width centered at 5 km/s. The Lee+12 mask correlations are from the
$$A_V$$ data masked in the same way as Lee et al. (2012). We can see that the
diffuse lines-of-sight favor a larger HI width, as shown by the correlations
which mask the dense lines-of-sight, 'Diffuse mask'.

***

We see that larger HI widths than found in Lee et al. (2012) are favored when
using only the diffuse lines-of-sight. This makes the [previous
results](/research/2015/08/07/threshold-and-intercepts-lee12data/#omitting-the-intercept)
which favored HI widths of around 30 km/s believable.



## Deriving HI width with Gaussian fitting

I followed the methods of [Imara et al.
(2011)](http://stacks.iop.org/0004-637X/732/i=2/a=78?key=crossref.9ab267e587f1b27674fc505072029a7d)
whereby they fit Gaussian functions to the average HI spectrum for a molecular
cloud, and determine the HI velocity range by the width of the Gaussians. In
this experiment I fit multiple Gaussians to each spectrum, then set the HI
width to +/- 2 times the standard deviation of the tallest Gaussian.
