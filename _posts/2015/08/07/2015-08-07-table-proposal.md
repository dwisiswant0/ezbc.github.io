In this post I outline the different possibilities for creating a table for
a rapidly growing child, Violet.

### What is the intended use of the table?

A custom table may be an expensive investment for a child who will outgrow the
table in a short time. The table may best be appreciated by all parties
involved if after the child's use, the table becomes a coffee table. 

### How tall should the table be?

We should make a compromise between the height of a coffee table and the height
of a growing child. [Reputable
sources](http://www.chartsgraphsdiagrams.com/HealthCharts/height-2-20-girls.html)
show female children grow quickly, reaching a height of three feet by the age
of three years. [Other
sources](http://freshome.com/2012/11/07/10-easy-tips-to-picking-the-perfect-coffee-table/)
describe coffee tables as being 16 - 18 inches tall. Indeed this is the height
of the coffee table in my home. I propose 16 inches tall.

### How wide and long should the table be?

Based on [extensive
research](https://www.google.com/search?q=toddler+tables&biw=1366&bih=657&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMIpqKXkruYxwIVAxWSCh3zGQcq#imgrc=lILQw_ShUXPgkM%3A),
toddlers play with small toys on tables. The table might accommodate such
activities were it 30 inches long by 18 inches wide.

### Accessories to the table

Previous conversations included discussions including a shelf under the table.
A shelf of course provides additional storage space. A shelf also may hinder
sitting at the table. If a shelf is to be installed in the table, I suggest the
shelf be installed near the top, only a few inches below the top.

is a rough example.

### Style of the table

I can accommodate several styles of the table.

+ [shaker](http://www.williamlaberge.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ShakerCoffeetableSCT.jpg)

As an example, here is a photo of a previous coffee table I constructed out of
cherry and maple. The style of the table is reminiscent of the shaker style.

</div>

### Type of wood

I recommend using maple or cherry, a combination of maple and cherry, or red or
white oak. Below are examples of each

+ [red oak](http://ldmbiz.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/media/small_amyk_13.15572608_std.jpg)

+ [white oak](http://www.yourpricefurniture.com/ekmps/shops/ypfurn/media/cirencester-american-white-oak-coffee-table-2543-p.jpg)

### Cost

Depending on the materials used and the style selected, the table will likely
be around $200 to $500 depending on the complexity of the table. The most
expensive to least expensive materials are cherry, maple, white oak, and red
oak. The material cost will scale linearly with the size of the table. I charge
$20 per hour.

### Next steps

Next we should agree on the dimensions, whether or not to have a shelf, style,
and type of wood of the table.  Please comment below or email me. I can also
make all these decisions if this is an overload of choices.
