Tomorrow I will be brewing a session IPA. See the [Brewtoad
Recipe](https://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/session-ipa-177). It's a simple beer.

We are considering either an [American Wheat](https://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=126) or an [American Ale](https://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=5) Wyeast.

We decided to do the [American Ale II Wyeast](https://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=11).

We used a total of 9 gallons of water: 4.5 gal for the mash and 4.5 gal for the
sparge.

Mashed from 160$$^\circ$$ to 155$$^\circ$$ over the coarse of one hour. 

Sparged at 170$$^\circ$$.
