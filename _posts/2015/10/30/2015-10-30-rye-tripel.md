A little birdie recently told me that a Tripel actually refers to triple the
malt of the Trappist "Simple". Triple the malt we shall have. 

This Tripel will emerge in the late winter as a hearty reminder of the warmth to
come. The predicted 8-9\% ABV will keep the body warm as we claim the outdoors
once again, while the lighter body of the Tripel will remind the consumer of the
promised summer. Rye malt will polish the Tripel's body with a spicy overtone.
Tettnang aroma hops complete the Rye Tripel with an earthy compliment.
