## The Box

A few years ago I built a jewelry box out of Bird's-Eye Maple and cherry as a
gift. The rounded sides and lid frame the hand-carved Celtic knot as the focus
of the box. The design is minimalist, yet elegant. Three compartments await
inside the box, along with a padded tray which rests atop the back compartment.
