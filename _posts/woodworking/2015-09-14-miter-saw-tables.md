## Rolling Miter Saw Table

I designed and built a portable steel-frame miter-saw table for use in the
Macalester College Theater Department [Scene
Shop](http://www.macalester.edu/academics/theatreanddance/facilities/scenicandcostume/).
The table is 6$ft$ long, capable of extending to 12$ft$ with folding
extensions. I installed a quick-access trash cut-out for discarding small
scraps immediately after cutting. The table allows the saw to operate at the
full range of its original miter angles. A vacuum below with a smart switch
turns on whenever the miter saw is used, limiting the amount of sawdust. The
table frame is steel mounted on four casters.

## Stationary Miter Saw Bench

I couldn't resist building another miter saw bench at my next shop
destination.  This bench includes much of the same functionality of the first
table I built.  The bench is about 8$ft$ long, with a 3$^\prime$
6$\in$ extension, has a hole for scraps, and includes a smart
switch vacuum-saw interface. Solid maple facing protects the edges of the maple
melamine table-top.

One drastic improvement of this miter-bench design is the adjustable position
in all three dimensions of the saw. I used a series supports and bolts between
the two bench sides to position the miter saw in good alignment with the fence.

Finally, I also built a fence clamp out of scrap cherry and maple. The clamp is
elegant, and compliments the miter bench.

## Construction

### **Rolling Miter Bench**

During my time as a tech theater assistant carpenter, we often needed to
crosscut a large amount of construction lumber on the fly on stage. This
activity warranted a rolling miter table. The previous miter table had a wooden
frame which sagged in the middle at the end of its lifetime. Our solution was a
steel-frame miter-table on casters, with extension flaps.

#### **Design**

I designed the table in a few steps, first sketching (see below for an
example), then rendering in a computer-animated-graphics program. I adjusted
the table design several times with the technical director's input, converging
on the final design shown below.

<div class="carouselContainer">
  <div class="variable-width">
    <div> <img src="/images/2015-09-14/miter_table1_plans.png"
               style="height:400px"/> </div>
    <div> <img src="/images/2015-09-14/miter_table_render.png"
               style="height:400px"/> </div>
  </div>
</div>

#### **Frame**

The frame consists of from 16-gauge steel 2$ft$ $\times$ 4$ft$ and
4$ft$ $\times$ 4$ft$ tube steel. I used a MIG welder to join the
frame. To support the casters I installed 1/4$\inch$


### Stationary Miter Bench

#### **Design**

The stationary bench was a much simpler design than the rolling miter bench.
My previous experience with leveling the miter saw with the table-top of the
rolling bench was not positive. This time I designed a mount for the miter saw
which could be adjusted in all directions. The design was relatively simple, so
I only made a sketch of the table before construction shown below.

         style="height:300px"/>
</div>

#### **Frame**

I wanted to avoid using screws as much as possible to prevent deformation of
the table over time, so the majority of the joints are bolted together. Below
shows the bench after I completed the frame.

    <img src="/images/2015-09-14/miter_table2_unfinished.jpg"
                   style="height:300px"/>
</div>

#### **Table-top**

The next step was of course to put the maple melamine table-top on. I cut the
table-top in the center of the bench to allow for the full range of
miter-angles available to the saw. I took my time installing the maple facing
along the edges of the table-top. Melamine is quite weak and tends to chip at
the edges.

After the table-top and facing were installed, I installed the solid-maple
fence. I secured the fence with carriage bolts which carried through the fence
and the middle joist of the bench frame.

#### **Table Extension**

Next I constructed the bench extension. To reinforce the extension I glued
another layer of scrap melamine to the under-side of the extension. I bolted
more of the fence onto the extension. Finally I mounted the extension with a
folding angle bracket onto the end of the table. The extension protrudes only
2$\in$ from the bench when folded.

                   style="height:150px"/>
</div>

#### **Fence Stop**

The last step was to construct a fence stop. Purchasing a fence stop was out of
the question for me considering the starting price was around \$100. I
mocked up several fence stops out of pine and with many combinations of bolts
and nuts. I converged on the design shown below, constructed out of cherry and
maple.
