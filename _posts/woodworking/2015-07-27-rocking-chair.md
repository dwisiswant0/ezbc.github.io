In 2012 I adopted
[plans](https://books.google.com/books?id=388DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA112#v=onepage&q&f=false)
for an Art & Crafts Rocking Chair from Popular Mechanics for a tech theater
woodworking project. Below are images of chair itself.

## Drafting

I redrafted the Popular Mechanics plans on paper as part of the project.

<img id="zoom_03" src="/images/2015-07-27/rocking_chair_plans_small.png" style="width:100%" data-zoom-image="/images/2015-07-27/rocking_chair_plans_large.png"/>

<script>
    $('#zoom_01').elevateZoom({zoomWindowPosition: 6});
</script>

<script>
    $("#zoom_03").elevateZoom({constrainType:"height", constrainSize:274, zoomType: "lens", containLensZoom: true, cursor: 'pointer', }); //pass the images to Fancybox 

</script>

## Construction

The Popular Mechanics article suggested that to make the rockers, one should
[kerf](http://stusshed.com/2007/07/17/kerfing-bending-wood-on-the-tablesaw/)
the wood, then plane away the leftovers to a smooth surface. I used a less
tiresome method, cutting with a bandsaw. This turned out to be relatively
simple. I used a belt sander to smooth the bandsaw cuts on both the top and
bottom of the rockers. In hindsight, a spindle sander would be much more
appropriate for the top of the rocker, where the bend is inwards.
