## Kombucha with Herbal Tea

I am thinking of making a lavender kombucha. After some research though I
discovered that many of the scoby's nutrients come from the oxidization of tea
leaves, i.e., green or black tea. One
[source](http://www.culturesforhealth.com/kombucha-ingredients) suggests I may
use up to 75% herbal tea and still have a healthy scoby. I'll try 50% herbal,
and 50% black tea.

## New Batch

I immediately contradicted myself. I brewed a batch with about 40% black tea
and 60% herbal.

### Execution

1. Fermented the scoby on 9/9 with 3.5 Qrts water steeped in 3 bags of
   darjeeling, 4 tsp of ginger tea and 1 C sugar.
