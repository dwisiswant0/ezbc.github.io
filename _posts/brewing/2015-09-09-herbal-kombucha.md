## Kombucha with Herbal Tea

I am thinking of making a lavender kombucha. After some research though I
discovered that many of the scoby's nutrients come from the oxidization of tea
leaves, i.e., green or black tea. One
[source](http://www.culturesforhealth.com/kombucha-ingredients) suggests I may
use up to 75% herbal tea and still have a healthy scoby. I'll try 50% herbal,
and 50% black tea.

## New Batch

Brewing a new batch. A simple one.

### Execution

1. Fermented the scoby on 9/2 with 3.5 Qrts water steeped in 4 bags of
   oolong, 4 bags of English Breakfast and 1 C sugar.
