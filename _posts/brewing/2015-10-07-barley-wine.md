When you need to face the frigid air outside, one seeks a bold beverage. One
seeks a beverage similar to a meal and enough alcohol to dilate your blood
vessels. One seeks a Barleywine.

I'm fueling my obsession with rye. This American Barleywine will have a lighter
body than an English, have slightly spicy mouthfeel from the rye, and lemony
aroma from Amarillo hops. American Ale Wyeast will bring the Barleywine to
fruition at 9% ABV.
