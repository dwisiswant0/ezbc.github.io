The [Kombucha](/research/2015/07/10/Kombucha/) from a couple weeks ago was a complete
success. The drink was the right amount of vinegary and sweet. It was well
carbonated. After about two days, the ginger flavor kicked in. I definitely
need to make some more.

Since last time I split the scoby in two by cutting it along the diameter. This
isn't how
[others](http://www.phoenixhelix.com/2013/03/27/kombucha-tips-troubleshooting/)
would do it, but I figured the scoby is an amorphous blob which wouldn't be
hurt by such a macroscopic disturbance.

### Execution

1. Fermented the scoby on 7/29 with 3.5 Qrts water steeped in 6 bags of black
   Irish tea and 1 C sugar.
