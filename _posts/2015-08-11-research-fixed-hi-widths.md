## Using the HI width with Gaussian fitting

In yesterday's
[post](/2015/08/10/research-lee12-hi-width/#deriving-hi-width-with-gaussian-fitting)
I used the method of Imara et al. (2011) of fitting Gaussians to the median HI
spectrum to determine the HI width. We then fix this HI width throughout the
rest of the analysis, i.e. in the masking and the MLE calculation. We only fit
for the intercept and DGR.

### Comparison with Lee+12

Below are the median spectra of each cloud fitted with as few Gaussians as seem
reasonable.

Median HI spectra with model fit in purple, and the HI velocity range used as
the gray shaded region. The velocity widths are consistent with what was done
in Imara et al. (2012).
