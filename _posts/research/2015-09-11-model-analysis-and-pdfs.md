## **Probability Density Functions**

[Burkhart et al. (2015)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150902889B) just
published a paper using the Lee et al. (2015) optical-depth-corrected HI and H2
in Perseus to examine the PDF of the gas and dust of the molecular cloud. The
HI-to-H2 transition was found to be around the peak in the $A_V$ PDF of Perseus.
We show a similar plot to their Figure 2 below.

##### **Figure 1** #####

PDFs of N(HI), N(H$_2$) and $A_V$ for each cloud. The HI-to-H$_2$ transition is
more easily identified in Perseus than in Taurus and California. PDFs for $A_V
< 1$ mag are likely very uncertain due to background subtraction and region
selection.

[Lombardi et al.  (2015)](http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201525650)
compared several molecular cloud PDFs using Planck/Herschel data. In Figures 1
and 2 two they show that the PDF of Orion varies largely for $A_K < 0.2$ mag,
about $A_V = 1.8$ mag, given different boundaries and background subtractions.
To be safe, we compare these PDFs for $A_V > 1$ mag. 

### California

The peak of California's PDF is about $A_V = 2$ mag. Lombardi et al. (2015)
shows a peak of around $A_K = 0.2$ mag. This is about 1.8 mag. This difference
is within the error in the intercept derived between Planck and 2MASS $A_V$.

### Perseus

The PDF of Perseus seems to show similarity to that of Burkhart et al. (2015)
(B+15). Our PDF peak is slightly shifted to $A_V$ of 1 mag, compared to the
$A_V$ peak of 0.8 mag in B+15. This is expected because of the positive offset
we calculated for Perseus $A_V$. The HI peak is slightly higher than in B+15 by
about 0.1 mag. This could be due to our higher DGR, different region selection,
and slightly different HI range.

A better comparison with B+15 would be to measure the widths of Gaussians
fitted to the rising side of the HI and $A_V$ PDFs. Look in 09/15 post for
these results.

### Taurus

The dust and HI in Taurus is less centrally concentrated than in Perseus and
California. Lombardi et al. (2015) shows a peak of about $A_V$ = 1 mag, similar
to what we have found.
