## **Probability Density Functions**

[Burkhart et al. (2015)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150902889B)
just published a paper using the Lee et al. (2015) opacity-corrected HI and H2
in Perseus to examine the PDF of the gas and dust of the molecular cloud. The
HI-to-H2 transition was found to be around the peak in the $A_V$ PDF of
Perseus. We show a similar plot to their Figure 2 below.

##### **Figure 1** #####

PDFs of N(HI), N(H$_2$) and $A_V$ for each cloud. The HI-to-H$_2$ transition is
more easily identified in Perseus than in Taurus and California.

## **Model Analysis**

I have successfully implemented the model fitting in the new monte carlo
bootstrap scheme. Next post I will present the results of the Krumholz et al.
(2009) model fitting.
