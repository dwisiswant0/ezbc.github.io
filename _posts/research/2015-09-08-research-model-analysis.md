## **Previous Modeling**

About 6 months ago I performed steady-state model analysis of the HI-to-H$$_2$$
transition for Taurus, California and Perseus. This analysis was for the
[initial](/2015/03/02/Perseus-HI-Threshold/) DGR and N(HI) derivations, where
the HI threshold surface densities were on order of
$$\Sigma_{HI}\sim\,4\,M_\odot$$ pc$$^{-2}$$ for Taurus and $$\sim 20 M_\odot$$
pc$$^{-2}$$ for California.

I've written a couple outlines for applying the [Sternberg et al.
(2014)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...790...10S) model. A detailed
outline can be found [here](/2015/03/06/Sternberg-Discussion/), with a short
summary and an application [here](/2015/03/12/Sternberg-Fitting/). Application
of the [Krumholz et al. (2009)]() model can be found
[here](/2015/03/19/Model-Analysis/). Finally the most thorough model
application can be found [here](/2015/03/23/Adding-More-Cores/).
